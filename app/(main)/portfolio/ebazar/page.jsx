                eBB, our go-to hub for all things construction, found itself at
                a crossroads when we noticed a drop in customer retention and a
                spike in queries about orders and shipments. It was time for a
                rethink. The goal? A user-friendly redesign that not only caters
                to our loyal users but also extends a warm welcome to those
                joining the eBB family.

                An interesting twist? Many of the vendors are seasoned pros,
                more accustomed to traditional shopping. That realization
                underscored the need for a website that speaks to everyone the
                tech-savvy and those who prefer a stroll through the market.

              I redesigned key pages like Home, Track Order, Product Info, and

              To ensure we're hitting the mark, I kicked off with some in-depth
              research and interviews with eBB customers, those who've been with
              eBB for over a year, digging into their experiences and pain
              points, to address real concerns and enhance the overall user
              experience.

                  Some find navigating through the extensive product range a bit
                  overwhelming. Simplifying categories or offering a quick
                  search feature could make their journey smoother.

                Through user interviews, a common theme emerged â€” the extensive
                range of products and services on eBB left many users feeling a
                bit lost in the clicks. This realization led us to a specific
                screen that demanded a redesign, aiming to present everything in
                a clear and organized manner, avoiding the previous hodgepodge
                layout. Let's dive into how we transformed this screen for a
                more seamless user experience.

                Following the implementation of the redesigned website, an

                tangible impact the redesign has had on overall product
                engagement and user interactions.
