                By putting together all the ideas from the interviews, I sorted
                them out using affinity mapping. This helped me see the patterns
                and figure out what's important for users. Now, these clusters
                of ideas are guiding me to create an HRMS that really fits what
                users need.

                I turned the traits from my empathy map into a User Persona to
                stay connected with the user during development. Keeping Priya's
                and Kunalâ€™s goals and challenges in mind, the focus was on
                creating a product for them to overcome their challenges. The
                aim is to make the product meet Priya's needs and make her
                experience better.

                By visually charting their thoughts, emotions, and challenges, I

                step has been guided by a commitment to user-centricity. The
                insights gathered from user research have not only shaped the
